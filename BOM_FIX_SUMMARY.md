# BOM (Byte Order Mark) Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Several XML files in the project contained BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters at the beginning of the file, which can cause parsing errors in some build systems and tools. The error "Expecting an element" in build.gradle.kts was likely caused by this issue.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Build Files
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - Removed trailing whitespace and potential BOM issues

### 2. Resource Files
- `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` - Removed BOM characters
- `app/src/main/res/layout/item_habit.xml` - Removed multiple BOM characters
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_habits.xml` - Removed BOM characters
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_mood.xml` - Removed BOM characters
- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - Removed BOM characters and fixed encoding issues

## Root Cause
The BOM (Byte Order Mark) is a Unicode character that appears at the beginning of some text files. While it's useful for identifying the encoding of a file, it can cause issues with:
1. XML parsers that don't expect characters before the XML declaration
2. Build tools that are sensitive to file encoding
3. Version control systems that show unnecessary changes

## Solution
All affected files were rewritten without the BOM characters:
1. Read the content of each file
2. Created new files without the BOM characters at the beginning
3. Preserved all original content and formatting
4. Verified that the files are now properly formatted

## Verification
After these fixes, the files should now:
1. Parse correctly in all XML parsers
2. Build without BOM-related errors
3. Show proper encoding in text editors
4. Work correctly with version control systems

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Configure your text editor to not add BOM characters to UTF-8 files
2. Use consistent file encoding across the project
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to check for BOM characters
4. Use a consistent file format policy across the development team

## Testing
While I couldn't run the full build due to environment configuration issues (JAVA_HOME not set), the files have been corrected and should now build properly when the environment is properly configured.
