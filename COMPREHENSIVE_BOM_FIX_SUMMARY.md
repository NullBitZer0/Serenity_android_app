# Comprehensive BOM Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The build was failing with a NullPointerException during resource compilation:
```
Cannot invoke "javax.xml.stream.events.Attribute.getValue()" because the return value of "javax.xml.stream.events.StartElement.getAttributeByName(javax.xml.namespace.QName)" is null
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters in multiple XML resource files. The BOM is a Unicode character that appears at the beginning of some text files, which can cause parsing errors in XML parsers used by the Android build system.

## Files Fixed

### Resource Files
1. `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - Removed BOM character
2. `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` - Removed BOM character
3. `app/src/main/res/layout/item_habit.xml` - Removed BOM character
4. `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_mood.xml` - Removed BOM character
5. `app/src/main/res/drawable/selector_habit_check.xml` - Removed BOM character

### Build Files
1. `app/build.gradle.kts` - Removed trailing whitespace and potential BOM issues

## Technical Details
The error occurred because the Android AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) compiler was unable to parse the XML files correctly due to the BOM characters. The specific error indicates that the XML parser was trying to access an attribute that didn't exist because the BOM was interfering with the parsing process.

When an XML parser encounters a BOM character at the beginning of a file, it can cause the parser to misinterpret the document structure, leading to null pointer exceptions when trying to access attributes that should exist but don't due to the parsing error.

## Solution Implemented
1. Identified all files with BOM characters
2. Rewrote each file without BOM characters
3. Preserved all original content and formatting
4. Verified proper XML structure in each file

## Verification Steps
To verify the fix:
1. Clean the build directory: `./gradlew clean`
2. Rebuild the project: `./gradlew build`
3. Check that the resource compilation completes successfully

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Configure your text editor to not add BOM characters to UTF-8 files
2. Use consistent file encoding across the project (UTF-8 without BOM)
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to check for BOM characters
4. Use a consistent file format policy across the development team

## Additional Notes
The build process cannot be fully tested at the moment due to JAVA_HOME not being set in the environment. Once the Java environment is properly configured, the build should complete successfully with these fixes in place.

All files have been checked and the BOM characters have been removed from the identified problematic files. The resource compilation error should now be resolved.
