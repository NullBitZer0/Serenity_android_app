# Resource Compilation Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The build was failing with a NullPointerException during resource compilation:
```
Resource compilation failed (Failed to compile values resource file ... Cause: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "javax.xml.stream.events.Attribute.getValue()" because the return value of "javax.xml.stream.events.StartElement.getAttributeByName(javax.xml.namespace.QName)" is null)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters in XML resource files. The BOM is a Unicode character that appears at the beginning of some text files, which can cause parsing errors in XML parsers.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- Removed BOM character at the beginning of the file
- Fixed encoding issues with special characters
- Preserved all original content and structure

### 2. `app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`
- Removed BOM character at the beginning of the file
- Preserved all original content and structure

## Technical Details
The error occurred because the Android AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) compiler was unable to parse the XML files correctly due to the BOM characters. The specific error indicates that the XML parser was trying to access an attribute that didn't exist because the BOM was interfering with the parsing process.

## Solution Implemented
1. Identified files with BOM characters
2. Rewrote the files without BOM characters
3. Preserved all original content and formatting
4. Verified proper XML structure

## Verification Steps
To verify the fix:
1. Clean the build directory: `./gradlew clean`
2. Rebuild the project: `./gradlew build`
3. Check that the resource compilation completes successfully

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Configure your text editor to not add BOM characters to UTF-8 files
2. Use consistent file encoding across the project (UTF-8 without BOM)
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to check for BOM characters
4. Use a consistent file format policy across the development team

## Additional Notes
The build process cannot be fully tested at the moment due to JAVA_HOME not being set in the environment. Once the Java environment is properly configured, the build should complete successfully with these fixes in place.
